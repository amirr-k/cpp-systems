# cpp-systems

This repository is a personal C++ systems lab focused on memory, concurrency, OS behavior, and performance. It contains small experiments and notes to explore how C++ interacts with the machine—stack vs heap, copy vs move, race conditions, mutexes, atomics, and basic timing—without heavy tooling or frameworks.
